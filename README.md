# TinyWS

## What is it?

A tiny WebSocket server written in Java 8.

## Why?

Because it's fun and I wanted to be able to have a WebSocket server without
several megabytes of dependencies.

## Status

Version 0.0.1.

It passes all tests of [Autobahn|Testsuite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite) version
0.10.9, except 12.\* and 13.\* (compression using the permessage-deflate extension).
