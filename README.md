# TinyWS

## What is it?

A tiny WebSocket server written in Java 8.

## Why?

Because it's fun and I wanted to be able to have a WebSocket server without
several megabytes of dependencies.

## Status

Version 0.00000001... Currently it's an application instead of a reusable
library. Very experimental and very much a hack.

It passes all implemented tests of [autobahn-testsuite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite).
